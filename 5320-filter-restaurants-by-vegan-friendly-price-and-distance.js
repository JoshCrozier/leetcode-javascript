/**
 * 5320. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/filter-restaurants-by-vegan-friendly-price-and-distance/
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei].
 * You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.
 *
 * The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with
 * veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you
 * have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance which are the maximum value for price and distance of
 * restaurants you should consider respectively.
 *
 * Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest.
 * For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity
 * veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
