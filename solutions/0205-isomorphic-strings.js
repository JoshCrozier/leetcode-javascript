/**
 * 205. Isomorphic Strings
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/
 * Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 *
 * Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 *
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving
 * the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character
 * may map to itself.
