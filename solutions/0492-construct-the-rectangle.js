/**
 * 492. Construct the Rectangle
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/
 * Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given
 * a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a
 * rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following
 * requirements:
 *
 * The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
 * target area. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which
 * means L >= W. The difference between length L and width W should be as
 * small as possible.
 *
 * Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web
 * page you designed in sequence.
