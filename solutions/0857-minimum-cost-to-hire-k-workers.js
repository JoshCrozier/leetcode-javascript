/**
 * 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/
 * Difficulty: Hard
 *
 * There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the
 * quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
 *
 * We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must
 * pay them according to the following rules:
 * 1. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
 * 2. In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means
 *    if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid
 *    twice as much as the other worker.
 *
 * Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying
 * the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
