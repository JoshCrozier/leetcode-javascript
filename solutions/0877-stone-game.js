/**
 * 877. Stone Game
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an even number of piles arranged in a
 * row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].
 *
 * The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The total number of stones across all
 * the piles is odd, so there are no ties.
 *
 * Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile
 * of stones either from the beginning or from the end of the row. This continues until there are
 * no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.
 *
 * Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins the game, or false if Bob wins.
