/**
 * 973. K Closest Points to Origin
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y
 * plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
 *
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance
 * (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
 *
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
 * (except for the order that it is in).
