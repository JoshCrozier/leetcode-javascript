/**
 * 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/
 * Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'.
 * In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.
 * A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by
 * deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.
 *
 * A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward
 * as well as forward.
