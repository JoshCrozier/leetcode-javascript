/**
 * 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-paint-n-3-grid/
 * Difficulty: Hard
 *
 * You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of
 * the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the
 * same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
 *
 * Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid.
 * As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.
